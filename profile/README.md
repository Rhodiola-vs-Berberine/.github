## Why Rhodiola is Better for Long-Term Fat Loss  

### 1. Targets Stress-Related Fat  
High cortisol (from stress) forces your body to store belly fat. Rhodiola lowers cortisol by 18%, helping you burn fat *and* feel calmer.  

### 2. Boosts Mitochondrial Energy  
Rhodiola strengthens mitochondria—your cells’ fat-burning engines. More mitochondria = more calories burned, even at rest!  

### 3. Fewer Side Effects  
Unlike Berberine (which can upset your stomach), Rhodiola is gentle and safe for daily use.  

**Pro Tip**: For best results, pair Rhodiola with other metabolism-boosting ingredients—like in **[Mitolyn](https://rebrand.ly/mitolyn-review-2025)**.
